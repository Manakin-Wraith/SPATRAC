- **Product Delivery**: Register the delivery of products, generate batch/lot numbers, and track initial quality checks.
- **Product Processing**: Process delivered products, update their status, and move them to the appropriate department and sub-department.
- **Barcode Generation**: Automatically generate and display barcodes for each product.
- **Inventory Management**: View a table of all products in the inventory with detailed information, including product codes, descriptions, and status.
- **Temperature Logging**: Record and track temperature logs for products.
- **Traceability Reports**: Generate and export detailed traceability reports in PDF and CSV formats.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for products using various criteria.
